### Installing Dictionaries

To import the dictionaries you wish to use for term searches, head over to [Dictionaries](dictionaries.md) to get set up!

If you do not have any dictionaries installed or enabled. Yomitan will warn you that it is not ready for use by displaying an orange exclamation mark over its icon. This exclamation mark will disappear once you have installed and enabled at least one dictionary.

### Scanning Text

Webpage text can be scanned by moving the cursor while holding a modifier key, which is <kbd>Shift</kbd> by default.

If definitions are found for the text at the cursor position, a popup window containing term definitions will open. This window can be dismissed by clicking anywhere outside of it.

### Audio

Click on the ![loudspeaker icon](assets/icon/play-audio.svg){ width="16" } _speaker_ button to hear the term pronounced by a native speaker.

If an audio sample is not available, you will hear a short click instead. For more options, see [Audio Configuration](advanced.md#audio).

### Anki

To further enhance your Yomitan experience, it's worth [integrating with Anki](anki.md), a spaced-repetition flashcard program to help solidify the words you encounter.
